Description: This was made on the whim, I wanted to see how far can I make a chess coach using stockfish and openrouter API. The answer? Not that far, it's usable, but not as good as the chess.com's Game Review. This was made in a day and I don't know if I have the desire to keep improving this. You are free to contribute!
